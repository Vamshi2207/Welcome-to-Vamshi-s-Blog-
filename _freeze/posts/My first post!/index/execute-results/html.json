Normally, you would need to do a through quality check on the data but for this group project, we will focus more on the modelling part. In real life, before modelling your data, you would need to take a deeper look at the shape and structure of your data set. Things like identifying errors, checking the distributions of your variables, checking for need for data transformation, should be always in your checklist before modeling your data.\n\n\\#### Task 1A: Data preparation\n\nThere were some data entry errors:\n\n\\- \\*\\*Status\\*\\* variable was coded 0 for certain individuals. Drop rows from \\*\\*creditdata\\*\\* when \\*\\*Status\\*\\* variable takes the value of 0.\n\n\\- \\*\\*Marital\\*\\* variable was coded 0 for certain individuals. Drop rows from \\*\\*creditdata\\*\\* when \\*\\*Marital\\*\\* variable takes the value of 0.\n\n\\- \\*\\*Job\\*\\* variable was coded 0 for certain individuals. Drop rows from \\*\\*creditdata\\*\\* when \\*\\*Job\\*\\* variable takes the value of 0.\n\n\\- For some variables, the missing values were coded with 99999999 to indicate that the observation is missing. Drop rows from \\*\\*creditdata\\*\\* when \\*\\*Income, Assets,\\*\\* or \\*\\*Debt\\*\\* variable takes the value of 99999999. You can use subset function for this task.\n\n\\- Declare the following variables as factor: \\*\\*Status, Home, Marital, Records\\*\\*, and \\*\\*Job\\*\\*.\n\n\\- Label \\*\\*Status\\*\\* variable as \"\\*Good\" and \"Bad\"\\*\n\n\\- If you end up with 4375 rows, then you are on the right track.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# drop rows with missing or invalid values\n\ncreditdata <- creditdata %>%\n\n  filter(Status != 0, Marital != 0, Job != 0, Income != 99999999, Assets != 99999999, Debt != 99999999)\n\n# convert selected variables to factors\n\ncreditdata$Status <- factor(creditdata$Status, labels = c(\"Bad\", \"Good\"))\n\ncreditdata$Home <- factor(creditdata$Home)\n\ncreditdata$Marital <- factor(creditdata$Marital)\n\ncreditdata$Records <- factor(creditdata$Records)\n\ncreditdata$Job <- factor(creditdata$Job)\n\nnrow(creditdata)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 4375\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\\# Task 1B: Split your data\n\nBy using \\*\\*createDataPartition\\*\\* function in \\*\\*caret\\*\\* package, split the \\*\\*creditdata\\*\\* by holding 75% of the data in \\*\\*train_data\\*\\*, and the rest in \\*\\*test_data\\*\\*. Use \\*\\*set.seed(5410)\\*\\* when you do the split .\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(5410) \n\n# split the data into training and test sets\n\ntrainIndex <- createDataPartition(creditdata$Status, p = 0.75, list = FALSE)\n\ntrain_data <- creditdata[trainIndex, ]\n\ntest_data <- creditdata[-trainIndex, ]\n```\n:::\n\n\n\\## Part 2: Classification Tree and Ensemble Model\n\n\\### Task 2A: Training with Classication Tree\n\nFirst, you will use a classification tree to predict \\*\\*Status\\*\\* in \\*\\*train_data\\*\\* with all the predictors in our data set. Use \\*\\*rpart\\*\\* function in \\*\\*rpart\\*\\* package to build a decision tree to estimate \\*\\*Status\\*\\* by using the \\*\\*train_data\\*\\* and name your model as \\*\\*model_tree\\*\\*. Since we construct classification tree, you need to use \\*method=\"class\"\\* in \\*\\*rpart\\*\\* function.\n\nUse the following parameters in \\*\\*model_tree\\*\\* (Hint: use \\*\\*rpart.control\\*\\* in \\*\\*rpart\\*\\* function).\n\n\\- use 10-fold cross validation (\\*\\*xval=10\\*\\*)\n\n\\- use complexity parameter of 0.001 (\\*\\*cp=0.001\\*\\*)\n\n\\- use at least 3 observations in each terminal node (\\*\\*minbucket=3\\*\\*)\n\n\\- Based on \\*\\*model_tree\\*\\* results, which three variables contribute most to classify \\*\\*Status\\*\\* in the \\*\\*train_data\\*\\*?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Insert your codes for Task 2A  below\n\nlibrary(rpart)\n\n# build classification tree with rpart\n\nmodel_tree <- rpart(Status ~ .,

We define Good credit status as \\*positive class\\* (when Status=1) and Bad credit status as \\*Negative class\\* (when Status=2).\n\n\\- Now, we need the performance measures to compare \\*\\*model_tree\\*\\* with the models you will create in the following sections. By using the actual and predicted Status labels in \\*\\*test_data\\*\\*, do the followings:\n\n1\\. Calculate accuracy and name it as accuracy_model_tree\n\n2\\.

In Random forest, many different trees are fitted to random subsets of the data via bootstrapping, then tree averages/majorities are used in final classification. We will use \\*\\*ranger\\*\\* function but since we want to go beyond out-of-bag error rate performance measure and want to get a better sense of the model performance, we will call \\*\\*ranger\\*\\* within \\*\\*train()\\*\\* function in \\*\\*caret\\*\\* package (\\*\\*method=\"ranger\"\\*\\*). This way, we can tune the parameters of the model.\n\nIn ensemble models such as Random forest, Out of Bag and Cross-Validation are the two resampling solutions for tuning the model. With \\*\\*trainControl()\\*\\* function, we can modify the default selections. In this project, we will use 10-fold cross-validation \\*\\*(trainControl(method=\"cv\",number=10)).\\*\\*\n\nIn this project, search through \\*\\*mtry\\*\\* values 2,5,7,9,11, and 13 and use \"\\*\\*gini\\*\\*\" as the split rule (\\*\\*splitrule\\*\\*).
